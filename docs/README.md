# ChessBrain

Machine learning is one of the fastest-growing and most exciting fields out there, and deep learning represents its true bleeding edge. ChessBrain â€‹is a web application that leverages deep learning and
websockets to accomplish a complete solution for chess enthusiasts. What we are going to accomplish
in this project is to build a web platform which will be able to load a game of chess from any given
image that might contain a still frame of a chess board. This platform will enable players to set up a
chess board without the hassle of moving the pieces and setting it up yourself. Platform will feature a
chess engine for a solo play and will also support multiplayer.
